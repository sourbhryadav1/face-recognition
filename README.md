# Self OpenCV Projects

## Overview
This repository contains five projects using OpenCV:

- **Face Recognition**: Uses the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm to detect and recognize human faces from images, videos, and live camera feeds.
- **Simpsons Character Recognition**: Detects and recognizes characters from *The Simpsons* using DL and a Kaggle dataset.
- **Virtual Paint**: Detects specific colors from a live camera feed and tracks their movement to create virtual drawings on the screen‚Äîjust like painting in the air! ‚ú®
- **Car Plate Detection**: Detects car license plates from images and live webcam feeds using OpenCV.
- **Document Scanner**: Detects and extracts documents from live webcam feeds by performing edge detection and perspective transformation.
