# Face & Simpsons Character Recognition using OpenCV and DL

## Overview
This repository contains three projects using OpenCV:

- **Face Recognition**: Uses the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm to detect and recognize human faces from images, videos, and live camera feeds.
- **Simpsons Character Recognition**: Detects and recognizes characters from *The Simpsons* using DL and a Kaggle dataset.
- **Virtual Paint**: detects specific colors from a live camera feed and tracks their movement to create virtual drawings on the screen—just like painting in the air! ✨
