# 🎭 Simpsons Character Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project uses OpenCV and Deep Learning to recognize characters from *The Simpsons*. The dataset is automatically downloaded from Kaggle inside the Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset API link from Kaggle is already included in the first cell of `simpsons.ipynb`.

- Run the first cell, and the dataset will be downloaded automatically.
- Proceed with training and testing the model after downloading.

## 🚀 Training the Model
To train the model, run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook simpsons-recognition/simpsons.ipynb
```

The notebook includes steps for:
- Dataset preparation
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## 🖼️ Testing on an Image
Use the test cell in `simpsons.ipynb` to check the recognition on a static image from the dataset.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
✅ Improve the model for better accuracy.
✅ Enhance dataset preprocessing techniques.
✅ Implement mobile support for real-time recognition.
